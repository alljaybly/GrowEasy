## Rural South African Savings Group Demonstration

---

### **[0:00-0:15] INTRODUCTION**

**[Scene: Rural community center, savings group meeting]**

**Narrator (Voice-over):**
"Meet the Khanyisa Savings Group from rural KwaZulu-Natal. Like many stokvels across South Africa, they pool money together but struggle with fair loan decisions."

**[Visual: Group of women sitting in circle with notebooks and cash]**

### **[0:15-0:30] PROBLEM STATEMENT**

**Nomsa (Group Leader):**
"Before GrowEasy, we made loan decisions based on friendship, not financial data. Sometimes good savers were overlooked, and risky borrowers got approved."

**[Visual: Traditional paper records, disagreement during meeting]**

**Narrator:**
"Limited internet, basic phones, and no access to formal credit scoring made fair decisions nearly impossible."
